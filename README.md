1) .csv file containing species' elevational and thermal characteristics used in main text
2) README file with meta-data for the .csv file that contains species elevational and thermal characteristics
3) R script file "pardosa elevational distribution scripts" that contains code for analyses in the main text and supplement
4) R script file "pardosa elev dist - subset spp" that contains code for analyses in the supplement that use only species for which there were at least 10 observations in Colorado
5) .csv file containing all CO occurrence records for Pardosa wolf spiders from the Ecdysis dataset
6) README file with meta-data for the .csv file that contains all CO occurrence records for Pardosa wolf spiders
7) .csv file containing species thermal and elevational characteristics estimated from all occurrence records vs estimated using only occurrence records since 1980
8) README file with meta-data for .csv file that contains estimates of species' thermal and elevational characteristics using all records vs only occurrence records since 1980
9) R script file "testing for sampling biases scripts" that contains code for analyses that test the potential impact that differences in sampling intensity and sampling time had on conclusions
